General information
===================

Pea (*Pisum sativum* L., cv. Greenfeast) cultivation protocol for ANU
works. This protocol is based on [Chow & Anderson,
1987](https://doi.org/10.1071/PP9870001) and [Zhu et al.,
2016](https://doi.org/10.1071/FP16222) with some minor modifications.

Protocol
========

Sowing (Day 0)
--------------

Germination rate is approximately 85–90%. x1.5 seeds should be sown.

-   soak seeds in water for ~ 5 h
-   sow seeds into 6x5 plug-trays filled with PAC soil
-   place plug-trays in a growth cabinet
    -   temp: 20C
    -   RH: 60%
    -   PPFD: 360 umol m-2 s-1 (photoperiod: 16 h)
    -   CO2: ambient
-   supply water until germination

Transplant (~ Day 6)
--------------------

Transplant seedlings to pots. The shoot length is ~ 5 mm.

-   place papers on the bottom of pots to supress soil runoff
-   fill plastic pots (diameter: 150 mm) with PAC soil to depth A (see
    illustration at the end of this document)
-   put ~ 10 grains of slow release fertiliser (Osmocote; Scotts
    Australia Pty. Ltd.)
-   place three--four seedlings per pot
-   supply nutrition twice per week
    -   1 spoon of soluble nutrition (Aquasol for all plant types;
        Yates, a division of DuluxGroup Pty. Ltd.) in 4.5 L water for ~
        30 pots

Start treatment/measurement (Day 18)
------------------------------------

A **third** leaf is usually fully expanded and is suitable for the
measurements. You may find an emerging **fifth** leaf.

Change log
==========

-   2018-08-09: version 1.0.0
    -   initial commit
-   2018-11-24: version 1.0.1
